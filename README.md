Trivia game about cats
The game "Cat Trivia" allows a user to choose an answer to six different questions about cats.  The questions are timed, so
the player gets 10 seconds per question.  The results of correct versus incorrect answers will be displayed after all of the 
questions have been answered.  It is just for fun, but it can improve the player's cat knowledge. The timer for the first
question will start when the game is opened.  The user will be prompted to type a y to continue playing or a n to stop playing.
The game will also show the correct versus incorrect answers after all questions have been answered. Detailed instructions are
given with the game.
